This project is a job posting site where the employer can post jobs and applicants can take tests if the user meets the specified criteria to apply for the job.
It is similar to linkedin implemented using node js,express js,bootstrap and mongodb for storing the data.
Passport JS was used for user authentication so that only a valid user can apply for the job
CRUD operations such as create,read,update and delete are used to perform interactive user actions.
